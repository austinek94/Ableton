## I own a copy of Ableton, can I get a simple Ableton template?
[Lifepoint Worship, TDR Nova Installer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jJN-qyA5rMhLA7nEroSKO5HGmZpZfD81?usp=sharing)
1) Download the Lifepoint Worship and TDR Nova zip files and then extract them,which can be done using a program like WinRAR.<br/>
2) Install TDR Nova and open the barebones template. <br/>
Note: If you own Keyscape and/or Valhalla VintageVerb, you can use the Sunday Set template. You can download the most up to date versions of the Sunday Set on GitHub. <br/>


## What are the differences between each ALS file?
Simple Template - Keyscape | Pad<br/>
Watch and Pray - Keyscape | Pad | Low/High Strings<br/>
Sunday Set - Keyscape | Pad | Low/High Strings | Synths<br/>
There are also various MIDI maps that are not present in Simple Template and Watch and Pray like the Master Filter.
