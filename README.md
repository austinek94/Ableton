# FAQ

## I own a copy of Ableton, can I get a simple Ableton template?
Download the Lifepoint Worship and TDR Nova zip files and then extract them. Install TDR Nova and open the barebones template. If you own Keyscape and/or Valhalla VintageVerb, you can use the Sunday Set template. You can download the most up to date versions of the Sunday Set on GitHub. <br/>
